(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaepolom/">My day job</a>)</p>
<p>Co-founder of <a href="https://colchesterbikekitchen.org.uk">Colchester Bike Kitchen</a></p>
<p>I live in Colchester with my wife and twin daughters.</p>
<h2>Extra Curricular</h2>
<p>I do these for fun.</p>
<h4>Colchester Bike Kitchen</h4>
<p>I founded CBK in 2015 with Pam Nelson and Stuart Welham (both sadly no longer with us) with the aim of providing a service where people could learn to look after their own bikes, or make use of tools they may not own themselves. CBK is now run by a small steering committee, still keeping to our original mission of empowering people with the confidence and knowledge to keep riding their bike.</p>
<p>Since then CBK has become bigger than we'd have ever dared to dream, staffed by 20 volunteers mechanics and those doing important jobs behind the scenes to keep things afloat. We have a large city centre workshop stocked with amazing tools, offer bi-weekly drop-in sessions and regular classes - we are totally rushed off our feet!</p>
<p><a href="https://colchesterbikekitchen.org.uk">Somehow this is still just a hobby</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>ColVelo Cycling Club</h4>
<p>My chosen local cycling club. I've been a committee member since 2017 and coordinate ride leaders for our Sunday outings.</p>
<p>I designed the current jersey, and design the prize t-shirts for anyone who finishes our five 'Monument' rides each year.</p>
<p>I've also somehow become the de-facto social secretary; regularly showing races at the local pub with charity sweepstakes. We've raised over £400 for various charities from chucking a few quid in the pot a couple of times of year. <a href="http://www.colvelo.co.uk/">It's nice</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Colchester Cycling Charter</h4>
<p>In 2019 we created the Charter as a way for residents, businesses, organisations and schools to show their support for the positive benefits cycling can bring to Colchester.</p>
<p>Since then, 52 organisations and over 500 individuals have signed the charter. <a href="https://colchestercyclingcharter.org.uk/">You should too</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Past work</h2>
<p>Various things i've done in the past and organisations i've worked with/for. Some for money, some not.<br>
If you'd like to pay me to do anything like this for <em>you</em>, slide into my DMs.</p>
